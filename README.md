# DAA_lab

This repository is a comprehensive compilation of questions, codes, and activities from the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** course. It is organized week-wise, using the folder names to reflect the topics covered each week. The structure is designed to help students prepare for lab FATs and reinforce their understanding of algorithmic concepts.

---

## Repository Structure

Each week's folder contains:

- **Lab Exercise**: Questions and solutions practiced during the lab session.
- **MCQ**: Multiple-choice questions discussed and solved in the week.
- **Practice At Home**: Additional problems for self-practice.
- **Challenge Yourself**: Advanced problems for deeper understanding.

`All codes and questions are collected to aid in lab FAT preparation.`
